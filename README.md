# weather-dashboard
This project is a simple weather app that will show you the current weather, as well as a 5-day forecast. It was made using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript (moment.js). The API being used for the weather is the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeather API</a>. As a default, the dashboard will load Atlanta. Afterwards, it will load the last searched city.

## What was the point
The main point behind this project was to get some practice calling APIs. I decided to use AJAX. Along with this, it would also give me the opportunity to practice some more HTML and CSS.

## Improvements
* I think it would be cool to add an image of whatever city you are looking at. So future progress could be to add that functionality.
* I included error handling if the API is not able to find the city but would like to add a notification to the user that it was not found.
